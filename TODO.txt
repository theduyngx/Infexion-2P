Evaluation function (ordered by priority):
    1.  Material / Power: Essentially RED - BLUE
    2.  Clusters

Clusters (ordered by priority):
    1.  Priority by cluster size
    2.  Priority by number of clusters
    3.  There must be a certain point, depending on the board's state, that maximizes the benefit between
        cluster size and number of clusters

Said context of the state:
    This is entirely dictated by the dominance factor of each side's clusters
    1.  Check for each adjacent clusters of opposing sides, which cluster is bigger
    2.  Second priority is the power of the pieces within the cluster
    Once again, there should be a mathematical balance between the pieces' stack powers and the cluster
    size it is in.

--> From this, we can conclude that:
    -   It is generally better to have bigger clusters than to have more clusters. Although this should be
        dictated by the dominance factor of the state.
    -   The dominance factor should be that: bigger clusters are generally better than small sized ones.
        Although some small size with large stack values should be a second priority to consider.
    ->  Therefore, it is not necessarily better to have bigger clusters. But sometimes, bigger clusters can
        still be dominated by slightly smaller clusters with large stack pieces.

    -   Hence, a move is considered good if it can, first and foremost, capture opponent pieces. How much
        better, or even worse, will then be checked by the effect the most has on the state's clusters.
        +   If our cluster will grow in size, it is also perhaps a good move
        +   If the opposition's clusters decrease in size, and that it divides the cluster up, it could also
            be a good move.
        +   In general, though, this is a balance act and the calculation should show that much. It is not
            always assured that a specific aspect being changed will necessarily always lead to a better
            result, but the general score deduced from all these factors will be the end-of-all.

OPTIMIZATION FOR MINIMAX:

1.  Endgame quick play (✓)
    Speed up end game, probably will require a different evaluation function where it significantly emphasizes
    on the piece power that we can capture.

2.  Weed out redundant moves (✓)
    There are lots of moves that can be considered equivalent as per domain knowledge (like spawning in the
    middle of nowhere here is the same as there). If we can, somehow in some way, weed these moves out of
    the picture, we can significantly speed up the process.

3.  Instant win (✓)
    Implement instant win (our real turn and we win immediately).

4.  Correct over-reduced spawn actions (✓)
    Specifically, in the case where all player pieces are of power 1, then player-adjacent spawn should be
    allowed.

5.  Enhanced move ordering (✓)
    In current state, move ordering should be smarter - The best moves are supposed to be ones that capture
    the most stacked opponents. The ordering should be sorted in this order:
    i.   Total power captured
    ii.  Reverse number of captured pieces (meaning the less, the better)
    iii. The player's piece power

6.  Reusing expanded / generated branches (hard)
    We will keep the tree in memory. And when the opponent makes a move, we will reuse the branch in which
    the opponent makes said move and continue with the minimax search.
    Of course, if the branch has already been pruned by alpha-beta, we will have to generate it from start.
    On a likely chance that the branch is not yet pruned, we will be able to reuse an entire depth = 2 tree.

7.  Transposition Tables and Board Symmetries (hard)

8.  IMPORTANT: so far our endgame greedy approach is not yet perfected
    What we need is to ensure that the cluster size that our player is attacking is smaller than the power
    of our red piece. Otherwise, the greedy approach simply won't work.

    Here is the requirement:
    As like before, the player must be able to capture the stacked piece. That is the pre-requirement.
    However, before even checking this, we can also check for the cluster size surrounding this stacked
    opponent. The requirement is that for every adjacent position surrounding the stacked piece, there must
    not be more than 1 adjacent ally:
        num_adj = [pos + dir for dir in HexDir if board[pos + dir].color == color.opponent]
        if num_adj > 1:
            stop function

    For even higher accuracy (but admittedly a lot more conservative), create the clusters and ensure that
    all enemy clusters are of size 2 and cannot exceed this number.
